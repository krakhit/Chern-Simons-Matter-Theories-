# Chern Simons Matter Theories
Mathematica Codes to compute various physical observables in 3d supersymmetric SU(N)
Chern-Simons matter theories. These computations are performed at the 't Hooft large N limit, while simultaneously taking the Chern-Simons level to be large holding the 't Hooft coupling \lambda= N/k held fixed. The results presented here are exact to ALL orders of perturbation in the 't Hooft coupling, these are examples of exact solutions in Quantum Field Theory and are quite rare.

A fundamental aspect of pure Chern-Simons (CS) theories is the Level rank duality. One version of it is a CS theory at a given level k and rank N is dual to another CS theory with the parameters Level and Rank swapped. When coupled to matter, these theories exhibit the duality in a intriguing way that maps entire RG (Renormalization Group) flows to dual RG flows including the theories at the critical points. The theories we study are often at the weakly coupled fixed points, so we can do perturbative expansions. However, to test the duality one need to extrapolate the results to the strongly coupled fixed point, and such a test is only possible if we were able to compute our results to all orders in perturbation. 

At finite N and k, these theories are realistic models that exhibit quantum hall effect. However, most of our computations are still far from this area. However, the duality itself is expected to hold, which may be useful for practical applications.

This is a facinating subject, dear to me, deep and intriguing in complexity and depth, with potential practical applications. While the mathematics behind it can be intimidating, the symmetries that one encounters leads to robust results, and the physical explanation is often so simple to understand.

I will probably put some kind of summary file, with all the background in this subject, perhaps an arxiv review, when I get time.
